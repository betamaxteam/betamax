# &beta;etamax [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/betamaxteam/betamax.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/betamaxteam/betamax) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/betamaxteam/betamax](https://badges.gitter.im/betamaxteam/betamax.svg)](https://gitter.im/betamaxteam/betamax?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Betamax is a tool for mocking external HTTP resources in your tests. The project was inspired by the [VCR](https://relishapp.com/vcr/vcr/docs) library for Ruby.

We've been more or less offline for 3 years, and we're reviving the project. Feel free to reach out to us with questions or concerns.

Documentation will follow soon. Please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/betamaxteam/betamax/issues) if there is something you'd like to see.

## Installation

Betamax is hosted via [Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/) and is intended to be compatible with any Maven-based build tool.

#### Snapshots:

[Snapshots](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/software/betamax/betamax-core) are made after every successful build in master, so if you want the bleeding edge, you know where to get it.

#### Releases:

[2.0.0-alpha-1](https://github.com/betamaxteam/betamax/releases/tag/2.0.0-alpha-1)
